## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14.x or higher recommended).
- Ensure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

## 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/sahinmeric/pangea-test-2.git
cd pangea-test-2

## 2. Install Dependencies
Due to dependency conflicts, use the following command to install all necessary packages:

**npm install --legacy-peer-deps**

This command will install all dependencies, ignoring peer dependency conflicts that might arise due to version mismatches.

## 3. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

**npm start**
This will start the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
